# Holberton Headphones

### Welcome!

This is a project, in which I have implemented from scratch and without any library, a web page. Using all the knowledge of **HTML**/**CSS**/**Accessibility**/**Responsive Design** that I have previously learned during the specialization of **Web Stack programming** at **Holberton school**.

The project consists of replicating a web page designed in Figma to HTML and CSS, the challenge was to make the page as close as possible to the design found in Figma and to make it a web page adaptable to various devices or screens.
